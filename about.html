        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>I have plenty of interests aside from programming. Here are some of them!</p>

        <ul>
            <li class="left">Writing - I enjoy writing poems and short stories. Most of it can be found on my Facebook account as well as my Wattpad account.</li>
            <li class="left">Editing - Although I rarely do it now, I still like to edit videos and I also have my own (dead) YouTube channel.</li>
            <li class="left">Reading - I love to read manga and visual novels.</li>
            <li class="left">Gaming - Of course, I enjoy gaming, specifically metroidvania and singleplayer games.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <ul>
            <li class="left">Manila Cathedral School - Grade 1 to Grade 10</li>
            <li class="left">CIIT Senior High School - Grade 11 to Grade 12</li>
            <li class="left">CIIT College of Arts and Technology - Currently 1st Year</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Throughout my school life, I've gained many achievements. I'm a consistent honor student and have received subject proficiency awards. This allowed me to get a scholarship in CIIT! I hope I can maintain this until the 4th Year.</p>
